To find X per instances, let

x = frequency or count

y = population of geography

z = people or instances

where

x / (y / z)


Example: Number of facial plastic surgeons per 100,000 people for each county where facial surgeons are present. In LA county, 85 surgeons are recorded. LA county has a total population of 10,000,000.

85 / (10,000,000 / 100,000) = 0.85 surgeons per 100,000 people
